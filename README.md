# Design_Patterns

A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It's not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code, but rather a description or blueprint that explains how to solve a problem in a way that can be adapted to different situations. Design patterns are widely used in software engineering to make code more flexible, maintainable, and scalable.
